"""Tunnel providers — "expose this local port as a public HTTPS URL".

The sharefile plugin owns exactly ONE provider instance, chosen by
``sharefile.yaml``'s ``active_provider`` (see
:mod:`slife.plugins.sharefile.config`).  Providers are the only thing that
differs between tunnels: ``server.py`` talks to the :class:`TunnelProvider`
surface and never to a concrete implementation, so switching tunnels is a
config change rather than a code change.

Every provider shares one lifecycle (:class:`_TunnelProviderBase`) and supplies
only the three things that actually differ — how to establish the tunnel once,
how to tear it down, and how to tell whether it is still up:

* :class:`NgrokTunnel` drives the ngrok Python SDK, which embeds the agent as a
  native extension — no external binary.
* :class:`LocalhostRunTunnel` and :class:`CloudflareQuickTunnel` spawn a CLI
  (``ssh`` / ``cloudflared``) and read the public URL off its stdout, so they
  share :class:`_CliTunnelProvider` on top of the base.

Contract the base guarantees, and which ``server.py`` and the harness rely on:

* ``start(port)`` is **synchronous and blocking**.  It is always reached
  through ``slife.threads.run_daemon`` (a plain daemon thread), never on the
  event loop, so it must be callable from an arbitrary thread with no running
  loop — hence ``subprocess`` and not ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec``.
* ``start()`` is single-flight and idempotent, and ``stop()`` never raises —
  it is called at shutdown while a start may still be in flight.
* ``is_reachable()`` splits "a URL exists" from "that URL would be served":
  ``is_active`` reports the former, this the latter.  They come apart exactly
  when the transport has lost the edge — the URL is still published while
  every request to it answers HTTP 530.  Same contract as ``status()``.
* ``status()`` is pure, synchronous, non-blocking and exception-free, and
  always carries a ``state`` key: ``active`` (a URL is live) / ``starting``
  (an attempt is in flight — the harness waits) / ``failed`` (terminal —
  reported only once an attempt has concluded, because the harness turns it
  into a one-time "tunnel down" warning) / ``idle`` (no attempt made).

    Two caveats worth knowing before selecting it:

    * ``cloudflared`` is **not** bundled with slife and nothing installs it.
      A missing binary is a terminal ``failed`` state with an actionable
      reason rather than a startup failure — but it *is* the common first-run

    * Cloudflare positions Quick Tunnels for testing/development, and its

      serves images sits in that grey area.
